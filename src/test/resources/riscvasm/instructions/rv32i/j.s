# j is a pseudo instruction. It jumps to a target address which is computed
# using the current pc value and an immediate value (= pc relative).
#
# Format:
# j imm
#
# Specifcation
# pc <-- pc + imm
#
# The pseudo instruction j is implemented by a call to auipc followed by a jalr
# instruction.
# auipc loads the upper 20 bits of an immedatiate to pc and stores the result in a register.
# jalr loads the lower 12 bits given by an immediate to a register value and stores the result into pc.
# In effect the combination of auipc and jalr load a 32 bit value into pc if the temporary
# register used in the auipc command is also used in the jalr command.
#
#
#
# example:
# Assume the pc contains 0x40000000 and the user executes j 0x2FFFC00/4 == j 0xBFFF00
#
# 1. Take the value 0xBFFF00 and multiply it by 4 because it is the amount of instructions with 4 byte per instruction
# 0xBFFF00 * 4 = 0x02FFFC00 = data_1
#
# 2. Take the lower 12 bits of data_1 (0xC00) = data_2
#
# 3. interpret data_2 as a sign extended value:
# In my calculator app, a number is sign extended only if you enter it as a 64 bit value:
# 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFC00 == -1024 = data_3
#
# 4. Take this negative value (data_3), invert the sign and add it to the original value (data_1).
# 0x02FFFC00 + 1024 = 0x3000000 = data_4
#
# 5. Take only the upper 20 bits of data_4
# 0x3000000 >> 12 == 0x3000 = data_5
#
# 6. Select a free temporary register (here: x5)
#
# 7. Take data_5 and create an aupic instruction
# auipc x5, 0x3000
#
# 8. Take data_2 and create a jalr instruction. Use data_2 as the offset.
# jalr x0, 0xc00(x5)

# The idea is to jump relative to the current program counter (pc) value.
