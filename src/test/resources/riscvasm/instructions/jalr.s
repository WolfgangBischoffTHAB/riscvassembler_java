# The indirect jump instruction JALR (jump and link register) uses the I-type encoding.
#
# The target address is obtained by adding the 12-bit signed I-immediate to the register rs1,
# then setting the least-significant bit of the result to zero.
#
# The address of the instruction following the jump (pc+4) is written to register rd.
# Register x0 can be used as the destination if the result is not required.
#
# jalr ra, ra, imm12
# jalr rd, imm12(rs1)
#
# rd <-- pc + 4
# pc <-- rs1 + imm12
#

# jalr rd, imm(rs1)  # rd = pc+4; pc = rs1+imm (imm is modified: least-significant bit of the result to zero)

#jalr zero, 0(ra)

jalr x0, 0xc00(x5)
