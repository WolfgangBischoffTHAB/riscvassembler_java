/**
 * The interlock is responsible for stalling the pipeline in situations where
 * the pipeline cannot prevent stalls via forwarding. The pipeline will stall
 * the earlier stages until the later stage has finally produced the data.
 * An example is a load from memory directly followd by a register operation
 * using the loaded data. The register operation requires the data in a phase
 * which the pipeline will arrive at even before the load has produced the data.
 * There is no way out of this without waiting for the data. Waiting is called
 * stalling.
